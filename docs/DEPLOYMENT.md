# Deployment Guide

This guide covers the deployment process and environment management.

## Environment Strategy

### Development
- Local development environment
- Hot reload enabled
- Debug mode active
- Mock services for external APIs

### Staging
- Pre-production testing environment
- Production-like configuration
- Integration testing
- User acceptance testing

### Production
- Live application environment
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Backup and recovery

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Checks
- **Linting**: ESLint and TypeScript checks
- **Testing**: All unit and integration tests must pass
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Build**: Ensure application builds successfully

### Quality Gates
- Code coverage thresholds
- Performance budgets
- Security scan results
- Accessibility compliance

## Deployment Process

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

### Deployment Steps
1. **Build Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

3. **Deploy to Staging**
   - Verify deployment in staging environment
   - Run smoke tests
   - Validate critical user flows

4. **Deploy to Production**
   - Use blue-green or rolling deployment
   - Monitor application health
   - Verify all services are operational

### Rollback Strategy
- Automated rollback triggers
- Database migration rollback procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Communication plan for incidents

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Application
VITE_APP_NAME=FeedbackApp
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0

# Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUGGING=false
```

### Configuration Management
- Use environment-specific configs
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use secure secret management
- Validate required environment variables

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- User behavior analytics
- Infrastructure monitoring

### Health Checks
- Application health endpoints
- Database connectivity checks
- External service availability
- Performance benchmarks

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging format
- Log levels and filtering
- Centralized log aggregation
- Security and privacy compliance

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Asset compression and caching
- CDN configuration

### Runtime Performance
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies
- API response optimization
- Client-side performance monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Deployment Security
- Secure CI/CD pipelines
- Container security scanning
- Infrastructure security hardening
- Access control and permissions

### Runtime Security
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability monitoring
- Security headers configuration
- Data encryption in transit and at rest

## Backup and Recovery

### Data Backup
- Database backup procedures
- File system backup strategies
- Backup verification and testing
- Recovery time objectives

### Disaster Recovery
- Recovery procedures documentation
- Business continuity planning
- Communication protocols
- Post-incident review process
